# Memory Task from Among Us
I enjoyed the memory task from the game Among Us. For fun, I replicated the task for the web.

Credit goes to the Among Us team! Cool Game.

### Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/lav-lav-r/game-memory-task.git
```
Open in Code Editor of Choice + Run

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Extension

### Caveats
- Starts as soon as it loads in the browser
- Hit the refresh button to restart the game
